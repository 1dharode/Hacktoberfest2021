# Chessboard Pattern with Matplotlib

## Description

This Python script utilizes the Matplotlib library to generate a visually appealing chessboard pattern with an overlaid chessboard-like design. It showcases the versatility of Matplotlib in creating various visual patterns and demonstrates the potential for artistic and data visualization purposes.

The program is divided into the following key components:

1. **Grid Parameters Setup**: It establishes the grid for the chessboard using NumPy arrays. The grid spacing, coordinates, and the extent of the grid are defined to cover a specified range.

2. **Creating the Chessboard Pattern**: The initial chessboard pattern (`z1`) is generated using NumPy's modulo operation, creating alternating black and white squares. This pattern is displayed using `plt.imshow()` with a binary color map.

3. **Custom Chessboard-Like Pattern**: A custom chessboard-like pattern (`z2`) is generated using a user-defined function, `chess(x, y)`. This function applies mathematical calculations to create a unique pattern.

4. **Display and Visualization**: The `z2` pattern is overlaid on top of the original chessboard, creating a visually captivating effect. The plot's title is set to "Chess Board with Python."

## Prerequisites

- Python installed on your system.
